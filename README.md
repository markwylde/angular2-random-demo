# angular2-random-demo
A random sample angular2 application that generates random information to test

Information
------
This really is just me playing about with Angular2. I've dabbled in it before but this is a bit different as Angular2 now has a binary release that you can access at:

    <script src="https://code.angularjs.org/2.0.0-alpha.22/angular2.dev.js"></script>
    
By using `chancejs` it generates a few new rows into a table with random names, which you can then delete by clicking the red button on the right.
